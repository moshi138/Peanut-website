            <p>Mohamed Salah is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Liverpool FC and captains the Egypt national team. Born on June 15, 1992, in Basyoun, Egypt, Salah is widely regarded as one of the best players of his generation.

He started his career at Al-Mokawloon before moving to FC Basel in 2012, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. After brief stints at Chelsea, Fiorentina, and Roma, he joined Liverpool in 2017 for a then-club record fee. Salah quickly became a star, setting a Premier League record with 32 goals in a 38-game season and helping Liverpool win the UEFA Champions League (2019) and Premier League (2020).

Known for his speed, dribbling, and finishing, Salah has won multiple Premier League Golden Boots and individual awards, including the PFA Players' Player of the Year. He remains one of the most influential African footballers in history.</p>
